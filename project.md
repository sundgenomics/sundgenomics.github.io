## Project with the Genomics Platform


To start a project, discuss some ideas, ask questions, or anything else related to the platform, please contact us via [genomics@sund.ku.dk](mailto:genomics@sund.ku.dk). We take meetings more specifically on Mondays and Thursdays. When you need a meeting, feel free to mention some time constraints you have on those days.

To book an instrument on the platform (e.g. bench, Fragment Analyser, 10X), please create an [account on PPMS](http://ppms.eu/ku/?Genomics) and then [email us](mailto:genomics@sund.ku.dk) so we can add the instruments to your account.

Please join the Genomics Platform channel on the reNEW slack. If you don't have access to the slack yet, please [email us](mailto:genomics@sund.ku.dk).

### Direct sequencing

If you are already familiar with our direct sequencing process (i.e. we have discussed it together in a meeting and given you all information so that you can use it), you can:

- get details on the [Direct Sequencing Service](/directsequencing/)
- submit a request [here](https://forms.office.com/e/Dgq0KkLsi3)

### Help on Computing

If you have computing or computational infrastructure questions, if you want to get access to the server danGPUThe, please contact [Sen Li](mailto:sen.li@sund.ku.dk). Here are some reference pages for information and convenience: 

- [DanGPU server](https://sgn102.pages.ku.dk/a-not-long-tour-of-dangpu/) for reNEW and [CPRGPU](https://lzg167.gitbook.io/cprgpu/general-info/readme) for CPR
- [Research Management and GDPR at KU](https://kunet.ku.dk/work-areas/research/data/Pages/default.aspx)
- [HPC facilities at KU](https://kunet.ku.dk/work-areas/research/data/data-collection-processing-analysis/high-performance-computing-facilities/Pages/default.aspx)
- [Computerome 2](https://kunet.ku.dk/work-areas/research/Research%20Infrastructure/research-it/computerome-2.0/Pages/default.aspx)

### Available bioinformatics pipelines

Genomics platform maintains several in-house bioinformatics pipelines as well as public pipelines for sequencing read demultiplexing and alignment to a reference genome. Please find more information [here](/pipeline_overview/)

### Acknowledgments

Please remember to acknowledge the platform on your publications and other dissemination materials (presentations, posters and similar).
