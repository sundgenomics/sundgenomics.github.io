## Project with the Genomics Platform


To start a project, discuss some ideas, ask questions, or anything else related to the platform, please contact us via [genomics@sund.ku.dk](mailto:genomics@sund.ku.dk). We take meetings more specifically on Mondays and Thursdays. When you need a meeting, feel free to mention some time constraints you have on those days.

To book an instrument on the platform (e.g. bench, Fragment Analyser, 10X), please create an [account on PPMS](http://ppms.eu/ku/?Genomics) and then [email us](mailto:genomics@sund.ku.dk) so we can add the instruments to your account.

Please join the Genomics Platform channel on the reNEW slack. If you don't have access to the slack yet, please [email us](mailto:genomics@sund.ku.dk).

### Direct sequencing

If you are already familiar with our direct sequencing process (i.e. we have discussed it together in a meeting and given you all information so that you can use it), you can:

- get details on the [Direct Sequencing Service](/directsequencing/)
- submit a request [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeSqTGVYCL0nbWNZZjvitcQ5drs0SUI86V3coCqVx7pSmD0FA/viewform)

### Help on Computing

If you have computing or computational infrastructure questions, if you want to get access to the server danGPUThe, please contact [Sen Li](mailto:sen.li@sund.ku.dk). Here are some reference pages for information and convenience: 

- [DanGPU server](https://sgn102.pages.ku.dk/a-not-long-tour-of-dangpu/) for reNEW and [CPRGPU](https://lzg167.gitbook.io/cprgpu/general-info/readme) for CPR
- [Research Management and GDPR at KU](https://kunet.ku.dk/work-areas/research/data/Pages/default.aspx)
- [HPC facilities at KU](https://kunet.ku.dk/work-areas/research/data/data-collection-processing-analysis/high-performance-computing-facilities/Pages/default.aspx)
- [Computerome 2](https://kunet.ku.dk/work-areas/research/Research%20Infrastructure/research-it/computerome-2.0/Pages/default.aspx)

### Available bioinformatics pipelines

Genomics platform maintains several in-house bioinformatics pipelines as well as public pipelines for sequencing read demultiplexing and alignment to a reference genome. Please find more information [here](/pipeline_overview/)

### Acknowledgments

- Please remember to acknowledge the platform on your publications and other dissemination materials (presentations, posters, ...)
- Remeber to mention the center grant on any publication:
   - reNEW: "The Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Stem Cell Medicine, reNEW, is supported by a Novo Nordisk Foundation grant number NNF21CC0073729" 
   - CPR: "The Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Protein Research (CPR), is supported by a Novo Nordisk Foundation grant number NNF14CC0001”
- If Computerome has been used at any point, it should appear in the acknowledgements: “Data processing and analysis were performed using the DeiC National Life Science Supercomputer at DTU (www.computerome.dk)” as mentioned on the [Deic website]( https://vidensportal.deic.dk/en/publications/acknowledgements)
- Please send us your manuscript before you submit so we can follow the timelines of the various projects we are supporting (and report on our impact), as well as review the technical details
