## PPMS booking system

### What is it?
PPMS is the online booking and ordering system we use in all platforms at reNEW. If you want to use the [Genomics Platform](https://sundgenomics.github.io), you will need to first contact us for an [onboarding meeting](/onboarding/). When the meeting is scheduled, you can prepare by creating your PPMS account (if you don't already have one). All users must have a PPMS account. Even if you might not use it yourself for booking or ordering, we will use it for recharging the price of the sequnecing kit we use for your project.

### Creating your account

1. Login with you KUID [here](https://ppms.eu/ku/start/)
2. Klick through to request an account
3. In the first drop-down, choose "reNEW internal charging account" (even if you are not part of reNEW)
5. Search for the account under your PIs name or the account number
6. If your group or alias is not listed, follow to "create a new charging account" and type in your Alias and Sted code
 
Go back to the [Genomics Platform home](https://sundgenomics.github.io)
