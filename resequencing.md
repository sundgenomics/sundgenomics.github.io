# Resequencing a Library

If you find that your samples require repeated sequencing, the Genomics Platform recommends following these guidelines whenever possible:

1. **Choose Repeated Shallow Sequencing:**  
   - Opt for repeated shallow sequencing of all samples instead of splitting them into two separate batches.  
   
2. **Avoid Adding or Removing Samples:**  
   - We do not recommend to add or remove samples to the re-sequencing run. However, you can use the initial run to find which samples should be combined in larger quantities to achieve an equal number of reads after both runs have been sequenced.  
   
3. **Maintain Consistent Sample Naming:**  
   - Keep the sample names the same between the runs.  

## Steps for Requesting Resequencing:  

1. **Fill Out a New Direct Sequencing Request:**  
   - Each sequencing run requires a new direct sequencing request. This is necessary because each run collects unique metadata during processing within the platform.  
   
2. **In the COMMENTS Section:**  
   - Write: "This is a resequencing of SUB24_000. Please pool SUB24_000 with the current run."  
   
3. **Copy the Samplesheet Excel File:**  
   - Take the samplesheet from the previous SUB24_000 submission and place it in the current submission folder for the upcoming sequencing run.  
   - Ensure that you do not change the sample names in the samplesheet.
