# Resequencing a Library

If you find that your samples require repeated sequencing, the Genomics Platform recommends following these guidelines whenever possible:

1. **Choose Repeated Shallow Sequencing:**  
   - Opt for repeated shallow sequencing of all samples instead of splitting them into two separate batches.  
   
2. **Avoid Adding or Removing Samples:**  
   - Do not add or remove samples during the re-sequencing run.  
   
3. **Maintain Consistent Sample Naming:**  
   - Keep the sample names consistent throughout the process.  

## Steps for Requesting Resequencing:  

1. **Fill Out a New Direct Sequencing Request:**  
   - Each sequencing run requires a new direct sequencing request. This is necessary because each run collects unique metadata during processing within the platform.  
   
2. **In the COMMENTS Section:**  
   - Write: "This is a resequencing of SUB24_000. Please pool SUB24_000 with the current run."  
   
3. **Copy the Samplesheet Excel File:**  
   - Take the samplesheet from the previous SUB24_000 submission and place it in the current submission folder for the upcoming sequencing run.  
   - Ensure that you do not change the sample names in the samplesheet unless you have added or removed libraries compared to the old run.
