## Transition to reNEW N-drives

### What?
Due to CPR closing down, we will transition our CPR N-drives into reNEW domain:
* SUN-CPR-genomics_data -> SUN-RENEW-genomics_data
* SUN-CPR-genomics-users -> SUN-RENEW-genomics-users
We will grant the standard access to our active users to the new drives as we go. If you need access and don't have it yet, please [email us](mailto:genomics@sund.ku.dk).

### When?

* From end of August, we will start sharing new data on reNEW drives and the submission folder will move to reNEW domain.
* As you know, the data are provided for 3 months max for you to grab and copy into your group infrastructure. Thus, from December, all active data will be on reNEW, there should be no archived data on CPR drives any more and will will close access to all.

If you have any questions, please [email us](mailto:genomics@sund.ku.dk).
