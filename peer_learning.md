# Peer Learning

Peer Learning is an ongoing training initiative by CPR/reNEW Genomics Platform with an aim to create a learning community within the research centers that are supported by the Genomics Platform: NNF reNEW, NNF CPR, ICMM and CGEN.

In this program participants engage in pre-made online courses to boost their data analysis literacy and bioinformatics skills. It serves as a platform for researchers to network and learn together.


## How does Peer Learning work? 

- First, people interested in participating the program fill the MATCHMAKING FORM.
- When there is enough of participants interested in the same course, Genomics Platform creates a Peer Learning Team and organizes an information meeting for the team in the nearest available timeslot. 
- During the information meeting participants sign up to pre-made online courses hosted in learning platforms such as Coursera, DataCamp, Udemy or similar - or to selected free online tutorials.
- During the information meeting there is an opportunity for Peer Learning members to elect a coordinator among themselves.

## Course Completion

Since the Peer Learning takes advantage of online courses/tutorials, each participant can progress through the courses at their own pace, but we suggest setting aside one month for a course that takes approximately 4-6 hours to complete. Upon finishing a course and receiving a course completion certificate from the online learning platform, participants must remember to unsubscribe from the learning platform to avoid recurring charges (if the course is not free). When a participant finishes the course and presents the certificate of completion, to acknowledge the effort, Genomics Platform issues a Peer Learning Certificate with KU credentials to the participant.


## Financial Responsibility for Courses 

Peer Learning participants are responsible for agreeing with their Principal Investigators (PIs) regarding the funding. While some groups may have a credit card to cover the subscription-based payment model, others can seek reimbursement. It is highly encouraged by the management of CPR and reNEW for researchers who require bioinformatics training to take advantage of these courses.

## Course Registration Process 

To sign up for courses, please fill out the MATCHMAKING FORM, which will help us identify the most sought-after courses among participants. The top three courses will be selected for the upcoming Peer Learning round. There will be three Peer Learning information meetings organised during the autumn semester. During an information meeting Adrija will provide an overview of the courses, and you will have the opportunity to sign up for your desired courses and meet your learning team members.

## Coordination Opportunities 

For those interested in taking a more active role, becoming a course coordinator is a possibility. After a Peer Learning teem is formed, participants have an opportunity to volunteer as a coordinator during the time the team goes through the course.  As a coordinator, you will help organize regular meet-ups for your learning team, track progress, and offer support. This role does not require advanced computational knowledge, and coordinators will receive a special KU certificate for their efforts. At the end of the year, a special thanks will be given to all the course coordinators in the closing event on Friday, December 8th.
