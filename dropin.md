# Weekly Computational Support 

The reNEW/CPR genomics platform together with reNEW system administrator Sen Li offers weekly data drop-in sessions to the researchers of reNEW/CPR and Genomics Platform users. These sessions are created to help the Genomics Platform users to analyze the datasets from ongoing projects and cover these kinds of problems:
 
- Help with working on dangpu server: set up pipelines, automate scripts (Sen)
- R troubleshooting (Adrija)
- Assistance in trying to recreate that fancy plot from that cool publication (Adrija)
- Assistance in data exploration (Adrija)
- Code reviews to improve research reproducibility (Adrija)

[Sign up here to help yourself (and us) to estimate how long is your waiting time at the session](https://forms.office.com/e/Xz1NZxXAgX)

We look forward to see many of you :-)
