## Sequencing Sensitive Data

### Genomic sequences are sensitive data
Whether the genomics sequences in themselves without any annotation and related patient data are sensitive or not is a grey zone in the field. However, following hospitals, genomics data repository and a general sense of restriction from the Danish regulations, the Genomics Platform consider the genomics sequences to be sensitive data by themselves and has to treat them as such. 

### The Genonics Platform is Data Processor
You can read about KU rules for data processing [here on KUnet](https://kunet.ku.dk/work-areas/research/data/personal-data/dataprocessors/Pages/default.aspx). A few extracts here:
   * University of Copenhagen may perform tasks as data processor for another research institution which is conducting a research project.
   * Personal data must not be processed until a data processing agreement has been signed.
   * Data processing agreements must be registrered in [Workzone - group 515](https://kuforms.ku.dk/xform/frontend/FormEngine/v2/ShowForm.aspx?alias=FA3027&groupId=2&casefolderid=1&doctype=5&formid=4102).

Some [general data processing agreements exist at KU](https://kunet.ku.dk/work-areas/research/data/personal-data/statistics-denmark/Pages/default.aspx), including with Capital Region H. Some info here :
   * The agreement lays down rules for the processing of personal data when the Capital Region of Denmark performs data processing assignments for the University of Copenhagen in connection with research projects. The agreement also lays down rules for the processing of personal data when the University of Denmark performs data processing assignments for the Capital Region of Denmark in connection with research projects.
The agreement covers both data and biological material. 
   * When UCPH processes personal data for the Capital Region: When the University of Copenhagen processes personal data for the Capital Region of Copenhagen, the University of Copenhagen will receive instructions from the Capital Region of Denmark. The instructions must be uploaded in a [UCPH formular](https://kuforms.ku.dk/xform/frontend/FormEngine/v2/ShowForm.aspx?alias=FA3027&groupId=2&casefolderid=1&doctype=5&formid=4102), so that they can be archived in the University of Copenhagen's archiving system. 
    
### What do we need from you
To be able to fill out the [UCPH formular](https://kuforms.ku.dk/xform/frontend/FormEngine/v2/ShowForm.aspx?alias=FA3027&groupId=2&casefolderid=1&doctype=5&formid=4102), the Genomics Platform needs to know (see printscreens below):
   * Registration of data controller
   * Specify purpose
   * Master Agreement journal number in WorkZone
   * Specify which data are transferred to companies or collaboration partners, for example data processors outside the EU/EEA, and specify the recipient
   * Technical and organisational security measures
   * THE DATA PROCESSOR AGREEMENT OR THE DATA PROCESSING INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE CAPITAL REGION OF COPENHAGEN
