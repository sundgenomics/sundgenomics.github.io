## Sequencing Sensitive Data

### Genomic sequences are sensitive data
Whether the genomics sequences in themselves without any annotation and related patient data are sensitive or not is a grey zone in the field. However, following hospitals, genomics data repository and a general sense of restriction from the Danish regulations, the Genomics Platform consider the genomics sequences to be sensitive data by themselves and has to treat them as such. 

### The Genonics Platform is Data Processor
You can read about KU rules for data processing [here on KUnet](https://kunet.ku.dk/work-areas/research/data/personal-data/dataprocessors/Pages/default.aspx). A few extracts here:
   * University of Copenhagen may perform tasks as data processor for another research institution which is conducting a research project.
   * Personal data must not be processed until a data processing agreement has been signed.
   * Data processing agreements must be registrered in Workzone - group 515.

Some [general data processing agreements exist at KU](https://kunet.ku.dk/work-areas/research/data/personal-data/statistics-denmark/Pages/default.aspx), including with Capital Region H.
