You can contact us by email at  [genomics@sund.ku.dk](mailto:genomics@sund.ku.dk).

### Onboarding

You are new to the institute and overloaded with new information. Welcome! Here is the [onboarding page](/onboarding/) for you to get in touch with us and get the onboarding information.

### First-time user

You did the onboarding meeting some time ago, but now is the time to actually start your genomics project and you forgot most of what we told you. No worries, send us an email at  [genomics@sund.ku.dk](mailto:genomics@sund.ku.dk). We'll schedule a meeting and discuss your project in details!


### Project support

The Genomics Plaform operates as a train-to-sequence and ready-to-sequence service for groups at [reNEW](https://renew.ku.dk), [CPR](https://www.cpr.ku.dk/research/facilities/genomics/) and [ICMM](https://icmm.ku.dk). If you have an open project with the Genomics Platform, you can find some more information [here](/project/).
