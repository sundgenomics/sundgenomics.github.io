## CRISPR applications

We have sequenced different types of CRISPR applications:
 * CRISPR-guide-library
 * CRISPR-reporter-library
 * CRISPR-amplicon

### Guide-libraries

We have sequenced projects using the following guide-libraries:
 * TKOv3
 * NGN
 * NGG
 * pLib013
 * pLib014
 * pLib016
 * TLS_ABE
 * TOP2_ABE
 * SUMO

If you want to add a new library into this list, please send us a file containing at least the following columns (and possibly more):
 * gRNA: the sequence of the guide
 * gene: not required, but if you have it, you can put it

### Reporter-libraries

We have sequenced projects using the following reporter-libraries:
 * pLib017
 * pilot_phospho

If you want to add a new library into this list, please send us a file containing at least the following columns (and possibly more):
 * gRNA: the sequence of the guide
 * reporter: the sequence of the reporter
 * insert: the sequence of the full insert
 * barcode: the sequence of the barcode
