## What to expect

ChatBPC is an informal gathering aimed to bring together people working with computational biology and bioinformatics of any level. The meetings are organised as discussion panels where people can share news/events/tools/publications they find interesting and discuss topics of interest. Reserve time to crawl out of your comfort zone of sitting in front of the computer (or lab bench) to have some human interaction with colleagues you don't see that often!

## Feedback

We would love to hear your input! If you have ideas on what topics should be discussed next, you can write to adrija.kalvisa@sund.ku.dk or just bring them on the meeting day.
