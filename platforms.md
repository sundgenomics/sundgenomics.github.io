## Genomics and Sequencing Platforms

Our Genomics Platform currently works with specific institutes at SUND: CPR, reNEW, CGEN, ICMM.
If you are not part of one of these, or if your needs are not met by our instruments and expertise, you might want to explore [the other SUND platforms](https://sund.ku.dk/forskning/corefaciliteter/).
